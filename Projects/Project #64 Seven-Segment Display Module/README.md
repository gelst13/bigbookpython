A seven-segment number display module, used by the Countdown and Digital Clock programs.

More info at [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display).

Requires sevseg.py to be in the same folder.

This is just an initial implementation of sevseg, as I need to use it for earlier projects. I'll come back and extend
this further once I get to Project #64.
