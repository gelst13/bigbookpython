## TODO List:
* Change `!=` to `is none` for comparisons with `None`.
* Change multiple `print()` statements at end to one `print()` statement with a multi-line string.
* Change date order from ISO to DMY; Can I add markers for ordinal numbers? (-_th_, -_st_, -_nd_, -_rd_)
* Display full month names, `Jan --> January`
* Add in 29th Feb.
  * How can I handle 29th Feb being less frequent than other dates?
